    "Now a quick chemistry recap. If we look at a water molecule, $H_2O$, and take a sum of the masses of its constituants, 2 hydrogen atoms ($m_H$ = 0.93878 GeV) and 1 oxygen atom ($m_O$ = 14.90297 GeV) we get a mass of 16.78054 GeV while a water molecule weighs 16.78552 GeV so we miss about 0.00498 GeV or 0.03%. This is because of the binding energy that we did not take into acount, however the difference is very small.\n",

    "If we now look at a similar problem but on an atomic scale, the mass of a helium-4 atom ($M_{^4He}$ = 3.7284 GeV) which consits out of 2 protons ($m_p$ = 0.93827 GeV), 2 neutrons ($m_n$ = 0.93957) and 2 electrons ($m_e$ = 0.00051 GeV) we see that the sum of the constituants equals 3.7567 GeV, a difference of 0.0283 GeV or 0.759%. Again the difference is almost unnoticeable and can be acounted for by binding energy.\n",

    "The real problems arise when we look at the protons/neturon mass. As stated before they are made out of even smaller particles called quarks and thus we can do the same. The proton ($m_p$ = 938.27209 MeV) has 3 valence quarks of which 2 are up quarks ($m_u$ = 2.2 MeV) and 1 is a down quark($m_d$ = 4.7 MeV) which gives a sum of 9.1 MeV. We see thus that we are missing 929.17209 MeV or 99% of the mass. And for the neutron ($m_n$ = 939.56542 MeV) which also has 3 valence quaks but this time they are 1 up quark and 2 down quarks, so we find a sum of 11.6 MeV. Again we are missing 927.96542 MeV or 99% of the mass. Now this time the anwser for the missing mass is not so straight forward and requires detailed studies of the quarks and their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first problem in the studie of quarks arises from the fact that they are what is called confined. This means that free quarks do not exist and cannot be produced, only a combination of quarks, such as in a proton or neutron, can exist. However since we know how that protons and neutrons exist out of the same quarks, up and down, we can look at their data and use that to infer the roles of the quarks and anything else that might be present in the nucleons. So extensive and detailed data from both the free proton and free neutron is required for this. \n",

    "# The EIC\n",
    "Before we get into the theoretical description we will look at the experimental setup that will allow us to study quarks in greater detail. The study of quarks using particle colliders have a long history, beginning with their discovery at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) in 1968. Which lead to the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics for Richard Taylor, Jerome I. Friedman and Henry Kendall. Since SLAC there have been many colliders, such as HEPL, HERA, DESY, CEBAF, JLAB and so on, each reaching new regions of physics with increasing accuracy. The next generation of colliders that will allow us to probe further into the quark world is called the Electron-Ion Collider or EIC. This generation of colliders will achieve a higher degree of polarization for both beams, a higher luminosity and a larger collision energy of the electrons and nucleons. To achieve this larger energy the EIC is one of the first colliders that will not use a fixed target experiment but rather the collision between 2 beams. This allows to reach higher energy regions as well as have the added simplification that the center of mass of the target and projectile system is approximately at rest in the laboratory which simplifies the analysis of the collision events leading to a better resolution. And as mentioned before the collider setup for counter propagating electron and hadron beams has many advantages over a fixed target experiment. The separation between of the beams of deflected electrons and target nucleons or its decay products is much easier in a collider beam than in a fixed target setup since all reaction products end up in a narrow region of the detector in the beam line. The ability to collide polarized particles will give access to the carriers of spin and angular momentum in the proton, and in particularly the contribution of the gluon-spin, which is something that previously has been unsuccessful.\n",

    "<figcaption>fig 4: Energy distribution of nucleon constituants.[9]</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above the missing mass or energy of the proton or neutron is a little more complicated than the other situations in which the, small, amount of missing energy can be found in the binding energy. Nucleons are a complex many body system in which besides the valence quarks other particles are present according to theories and experiments. One of which are the gluons, the force carrier of the strong force, and sea quarks, a constant creations of quark anti-quark pairs from gluons that are then annihilated. Gluons themself have no mass and the valence quaks as stated above are nearly massless and only contribute for about a percentage. So the combination of gluons and sea quarks will be crucial to understand where the mass of the heavy nucleons is coming from. but the precise mechanism is poorly understood and the use of high energy colliders to obtain very precise measurements of distribution of quarks in both space and momentum will shed light on this. \n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Than there is the spin of the nucleon. Both proton and neutron have spin 1/2, a property that is used for example in magnetic resonance imaging or MRI. But a similar problem as before with the mass arises. Naively this total spin could be the sum of the spin of the 3 valence quarks, but experiments have shown that the valence quarks only contribute no more than 30% to the total spin. So the question remains, where does the rest of the spin comes from. Possible origins could be the spin of the gluons, the angular momentum of all the quarks (including sea quarks) and the angular momentum of the Gluons. Very little data is available about this, so the higher resolution of the EIC will allow a better study of the origin of spin. More about this can be found in [9] and [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these properties can already be study by the use of inclusive deep inelastic scattering, where after the collision between an electron and a nucleon only the scattered electron is measured. This has already revealed some basic information about the nucleons, such as the existence of valence quarks. But this can only give a one-dimensional picture of the substructure of the nucleon, such as the fraction of the nucleon's momentum that is carried by the struck quark in the direction of the incident electron. This longitudinal momentum fraction, x, is called a parton distribution function (PDF). For a more detailed analysis a 3D picture is needed which can be achieved by measuring all reaction particles, which is called exclusive DIS. This 3D picture of the nucleon in momentum space will provide new knowledge about the transverse momentum distributions (TMDs) which could be related to the nucleon spin direction.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "Since we know that a free neutron cannot be used in an experiment because of its decay, a deuteron will be used instead and the free neutrons properties will be inferred from that. For this extraction of the free neutron structure functions and asymmetries, a technique called spectator proton tagging will be employed. In this technique the scattered electron and final state proton will be detected. By using the data for the deuteron ensemble and the state of the detected electron and proton a polynomial can be fitted which will lead to the free neutron case after on-shell extrapolation. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the scientific reasons for building the EIC. There is of course also the technological reason. Building such an accelerator capable of exploring such high energy regions and answering the questions above and others that might arise requires the innovation of new technologies, some of which often find their way into everyday life such as the invention of touch screen or most famously the internet at CERN ([11], [12])."
